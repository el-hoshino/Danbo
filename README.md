# Danbo
Danbo is a wrapper framework for CGAffineTransform, including a Playground to test your transforms.

The name **Danbo** is from the nickname of my friend, [ktanaka117](https://github.com/ktanaka117/). This framework is kind of made for him (:P), and that's why I used Method Chaining as an API to make transforms: I personally don't like method chaining syntax very much, but he likes it :).
